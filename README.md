# RepostBuster

## What is this?

Image hosting sites including Twitter and Instagram have become great platforms for artists to share their work with thousands of people on the internet. These artists can range from simple hobbiests to seasoned industry professionals, but there is one thing that all online artists come in contact with: **Art Theft**.

There are countless instances of people reuploading images without sourcing the author, unrightfully using images for commercial use, or even just flat out pladgiarism of other peoples work. 

Combating art theft can be a tedious and time consuming process, and there are practically no tools currently available for people to fight this problem.

That's where RepostBuster comes in.

**RepostBuster will be an easy to use web application that finds instances of reposted images on the internet.**

The goal of RepostBuster will be to help enforce the digital license and copyright of digital artists and their artwork. 


## Okay. But how will this work?

The user will be able to upload an image to the program. RepostBuster will then use this image to perform a **reverse image search** to find any duplicate instances of the image on the internet. The user will also provide their own credetials so that the program will only find instances of the image being used by other people.

RepostBuster will provide the user of a list of links to any reuploaded instances that it finds. 

### Techstack 

This will be possible through the use of the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision), which will make the image search functionality possible.

The rest will be made possible using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and will be deployed as a web application.

## Thats cool, but how will you get this done?

The only major roadblock will be learning how to implement the reverse image search functionality in a usable way. The rest will involve integrating it into a web application with an easy to use front end.

I estimate a team of 4-5 people will allow us to propperly complete this project for this class.
